## Ping-Pong

Description: This website was made to allow the user to play the number game ping-pong.
The user enters a number and the website outputs a list of numbers up to the number the user inputs. The website outputs "ping" everytime it finds a multiple of 3, "pong" whenever it finds a multiple of 5, and "ping-pong" whenever it finds a multiple of both 3 and 5.
